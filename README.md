# TMDB5000-Movie-Dataset

## Introduction
In this notebook, we investigate the 'TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset' from kaggle supporting us with data on the plot, cast, crew, budget, and revenues of several thousand films.

With this data, we will have a more detailed look at the Walt Disney Group and its position in the movie scene. With the acquisition of Marvel Studios and Lucasfilm is this already a position that is dominating the market? To answer this, we will answer the following questions:

Is there a favoured genre by the Disney Group?
Is there a difference in terms of budget per film for the Disney Group and the whole dataset?
Are Disney movies more succesful than other movies?
Is there a relation between budget and revenue?

Follow along using the Jupyter notebook to find out the answers to above questions.
